# OBLIVISCOR

Obliviscor is Latin for "I lose remembrance of"â€”I forgot. This game is the beginning of the journey of a soul who forgot who they once were, and tries to understand where they are supposed to go. It's very much a demo, but it has the foundations to scale it up. This is the first time I've ever used pygame, and I enjoyed doing pixel art for the first time as well.
